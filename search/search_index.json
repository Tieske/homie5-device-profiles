Where the Homie Convention provides a standardized way for device discovery, descriptions, and value/event update publishing, the profiles defined here will add meaning to those devices, nodes and properties published. When using the Homie Convention to describe a light-bulb for example, there are many ways in which this can be done; a single property power : 0-100% a single property brightness : 0-255 a boolean power property and a brightness property 0-100% Now how is a Homie controller to know all of the possible different implementations? Hence we define a profile with a unique name and publish it along with the device description. The official Homie Profiles are documented in this project. Goals provide a unambiguous representation of the state a device is in provide a strict expectation for the user how a device behaves make it easy to discover compatible devices/capabilities allow flexibility in having required/optional/custom elements provide hints for a UI, without specifying the UI implementation Types of profiles Profiles are defined on 2 levels; Capability level: this maps to a Homie \"node\" within a device, and it defines the properties for the capability/node. Device level: this maps to the Homie device, and it defines the capabilities for the device This structure allows for reuse of Capability profiles across different Device profiles Capability profiles Capability profiles are defined on a node level. Each node represents a certain capability a device posesses which provides state or functionality via its properties. A Capability profile specifies the following: required properties; eg. a Dimmer MUST have a \"brightness\" property optional properties; eg. a Dimmer MAY have a \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" property node/capability behaviour across properties to make behaviour unambiguous. For example: if either \"minimum\" or \"maximum\" is provided, the other MUST also be provided If \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" are provided, then the actual value sent to the device will be the \"brightness\" value mapped to the range between \"minimum\" and \"maximum\". Note: Capabilities MAY have additional properties, unless specified otherwise. Each node represents an instantiation of a capability. There can be more than one of the same capability on a device (e.g. 2 button capability nodes for a wall switch with 2 buttons) Device profiles A device profile specifies the following: required capabilities; eg. a Light MUST have a \"switch\" capability optional capabilities; eg. a Light MAY have a \"dimmer\" capability device/node/property behaviour across capabilities to make behaviour unambiguous. For example: If a device has a \"color\" capability, then it MUST also have a \"dimmer\" capability Changing the \"dimmer\" state MUST NOT change the \"switch\" state Note: devices MAY have additional Capabilities and/or Nodes, unless specified otherwise. Advertizing The way the profile is announced is 2 fold. It is advertized using a Homie MQTT topic, as well as in the JSON description document. The components of the profile consist of the profile name, as well as the supported version (major+minor). Capability advertizing The node level attribute where to publish the profile in use is: $profile . The topic will have the name and the major version number, where the value contains the minor version number; homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/[profile]/[maj] \u2192 \"[min]\" The device description JSON document, in the node-object; { ..., \"$profile\": [\"[profile]/[maj]/[min]\"], ... } Note : in the JSON document the $profile property holds an array value, not a single string. See versioning below. So for a homie-sensor-temperature , version 1.3 , documented as homie-sensor-temperature/1/3 the capability would be advertized as: homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/1 \u2192 \"3\" { ..., \"$profile\": [\"homie-sensor-temperature/1/3\"], ... } Capability searching For controllers looking to find a specific type of device they are compatible with, they can use the published MQTT topic to query for the specific capabilities. For example: Topic subscription result homie/5/*/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/* Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities homie/5/mydevice/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/* Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities of device mydevice homie/5/*/*/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/2 Will return all homie-sensor-temperature capabilities compatible with version 2 By parsing the returned topics and values, all relevant data can be extracted: device id node id supported capability major version supported capability minor version Versioning Versioning is based on SemVer and is only done using the major and minor version components. This is because the profiles are description documents describing features and functionality. Any patch update would only be a clarification, never a change. Hence it does not make sense to advertize or search for versions including a patch version. Since minor versions are backward compatible within a major version, there is no need to ever list multiple minor versions. A device should only advertize the latest minor version it is compatible with. Eg. if a device advertizes version 1.2 , it is implicit that it also supports versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the same profile. If a device or a node supports either multiple profiles, or supports multiple major versions of a profile, then they can all be advertized. Here's an example of a capability supporting 2 profiles, and one of them in 2 versions: homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/1 \u2192 \"2\" homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/homie-sensor-temperature/2 \u2192 \"0\" homie/5/[device]/[node]/$profile/power-switch/1 \u2192 \"3\" { ..., \"$profile\": [ \"homie-sensor-temperature/1/2\", \"homie-sensor-temperature/2/0\", \"power-switch/1/3\" ], ... } So overall profile support in this example is: homie-sensor-temperature , versions 1.0 to 1.2 , and 2.0 power-switch , versions 1.0 to 1.3 Note : for this to work it is essential that there are no naming collissions between the properties used in each of the profiles.","title":"Introduction to Homie Profiles"},{"location":"#introduction-to-homie-profiles","text":"","title":"Introduction to Homie Profiles"},{"location":"#abstract","text":"This document aims to list a set of predefined device and capability profiles to be used in IoT and home automation scenarios.

Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Numeric sensors introduction A sensor node measures a single sensor value. The value is published under the property value . The descriptions vary by the type of value measured. Depending on the type of sensor, some properties and/or requirements my vary. They are very strictly defined, allowing only for a single unit or format attribute. This allows MQTT based querying of specific sensor types, without having to parse the device description. Virtual sensors Sensors can be virtual sensors, in the sense that the value is not actually measured, but set by a Homie controller. The profile takes this into account by allowing the (raw) value to be settable in those cases. For example; a virtual temperature sensor that is set by a controller as the averaga value of all temperature sensors in a room. a virtual motion sensor called \"ground-floor\", that has state \"presence\" as long as any of the sensors on the ground floor is tripped. By implementing the optional raw property the sensor values become settable, and hence the same profile can be used as a virtual sensor. homie-sensor-numeric/1/0 This is the common version if no specific profile is available. The profile name is: homie-sensor-numeric/1/0 . Description A numerical sensor is a sensor for any numerical type data, eg. speed, temperature, volume etc. The type is not further specified, because it can be set using the regular unit attribute on the value. In a similar way the limits and precision can be specified using the format property. The most basic implementation will only have a value property. There are more advanced options that support calibration, and virtual sensors of this type. Specifically typed sensors are available for the most common formats. Each with their own profile name and version. The Node layout is the same for all, they only differ by supported unit types Required properties value The value property (required) is the property that holds the sensor value (after calibration). attributes value remark property-id \" value \" settable false virtual sensors can set the raw property. retained true unit the unit attribute on this property MUST be specified, see the Homie specification for most common supported units. format the format attribute SHOULD be specified for precision, minimum and maximum values. type \" float \" To represent integers, us the format attribute If any of the calibration properties are present, then the value is calculated as: value = (raw-value + offset) * factor The offset defaults to 0 if not present, and the factor defaults to 1 if not present. Optional properties raw The raw property (optional) is the property that holds the raw sensor value, before calibration. Note: : This property becomes REQUIRED when any of the following properties are present; raw-topic , offset , or factor . attributes value remark property-id \" raw \" settable true / false mostly non-settable, except for virtual sensors. retained true type float unit Can be any unit, but most likely the same as the value property (or a corresponding type, eg. \u00b0F as the raw type, with \u00b0C as the value type) raw-topic The \" raw-topic \" property (optional) is an MQTT topic where the raw-value should be fetched (by subscribing to it). This allows for creating Homie sensors from any MQTT topic in the system. The behaviour when receiving a value update from the subscription should be as if the \" raw \" property was settable, and received a value on its \" /set \" topic. If the value is set to an empty string, then the topic subscription should be cancelled. attributes value remark property-id \" raw-topic \" settable true retained true type string unit \"\" This MUST remain unset, since it relies on the configurable remote value. offset The offset property (optional) is used to calibrate the raw sensor value.
