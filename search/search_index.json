Where the Homie Convention provides a standardized way for device discovery, descriptions, and value/event update publishing, the profiles defined here will add meaning to those devices, nodes and properties published. When using the Homie Convention to describe a light-bulb for example, there are many ways in which this can be done; a single property power : 0-100% a single property brightness : 0-255 a boolean power property and a brightness property 0-100% Now how is a Homie controller to know all of the possible different implementations? Hence we define a profile with a unique name and publish it along with the device description. The official Homie Profiles are documented in this project. Goals provide a unambiguous representation of the state a device is in provide a strict expectation for the user how a device behaves allow flexibility in having required/optional/custom elements provide hints for a UI, without specifying the UI implementation Profile structure Profiles are defined on 2 levels; 1. Device level: this maps to the Homie device, and it defines the capabilities for the device 2. Capability level: this maps to a Homie \"node\" within a device, and it defines the properties for the capability/node. This structure allows for reuse of Capability profiles across different Device profiles Device profiles A device profile specifies the following: required capabilities; eg. a Light MUST have a \"switch\" capability optional capabilities; eg. a Light MAY have a \"dimmer\" capability device/node/property behaviour across capabilities to make behaviour unambiguous. eg. If a device has a \"color\" capability, then it MUST also have a \"dimmer\" capability Changing the \"dimmer\" state MUST NOT change the \"switch\" state Note: devices MAY have additional Capabilities and/or Nodes, unless specified otherwise. Capability profiles Capability profiles are defined on a node level. Each node represents a certain capability a device posesses which provides state or functionality via its properties. A Capability profile specifies the following: required properties; eg. a Dimmer MUST have a \"brightness\" property optional properties; eg. a Dimmer MAY have a \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" property node/capability behaviour across properties to make behaviour unambiguous. eg. if either \"minimum\" or \"maximum\" is provided, the other MUST also be provided If \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" are provided, then the actual value sent to the device will be the \"brightness\" value mapped to the range between \"minimum\" and \"maximum\". Note: - Capabilities MAY have additional properties, unless specified otherwise. - Each node represents an instantiation of a capability. There can be more than one of the same capability on a device (e.g. 2 button capability nodes for a wall switch with 2 buttons) Device descriptions Light type : \"homie-device-profile/v1/type=light\" This device represents binary and dimmable lights with no color. Device capabilities id type optional comment switch homie-capability-profile/v1/type=switch no n.a. dimmer homie-capability-profile/v1/type=dimmer yes n.a The id is the required name on the Homie \"Node\" level Inter-capability behaviour The switch has no effect on the dimmer state, nor the dimmer state on the switch. Examples: state action result remark switch.state=true, dimmer.brightness=50 set switch.state=false switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=50 brightness is unchanged switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=50 set dimmer.brightness=60 switch.state=false, dimmer.brightness=60 light remains off Capability descriptions Switch type : \"homie-capability-profile/v1/type=switch\" Example usages : Represent a switchable actor, e.g. wall socket plug, light bulb. Properties id type settable (default) retained unit format comment state boolean yes yes - off,on format specifies labels for false/true action enum yes no - toggle toggles state between true and false Comments: Since a boolean does not carry any context, the format property specifies the labels for the boolean values. The format is the same as an enum where false is the first and true is the second entry. Reasoning is that if the enum is an array , and false is often represented as 0 and true often as 1. Then those 0/1 values are the indices of the format array to ease implementations. This format entry requires a change to the Homie protocol The value could also be specified as an enum all together, but having a boolean provides a hint to a UI as to how to render the property (see the \"goals\" section\"). Dimmer type : \"homie-capability-profile/v1/type=dimmer\" Example usages : Dimmable light. Properties id type settable (default) retained unit format comment brightness integer yes yes % 1:100 0 is not allowed since it would be ambiguous action enum yes no - brighter,darker Comments: brightness is restricted from 1 to 100%, 0 would be ambiguous. It is important to note that this is the STATE representation, not the UI representation. A UI is still free in how it renders the state; a single slider 0-100, a switch and 1-100, or a switch and 0-100. The brighter and darker actions are problematic in so far as that we would need to define the delta adjustment value. But depending on the devices practical values could be difficult to align. An argument could be made to completly remove this feature all together but it has proved to be rather practical in home automation scenarios. Another way could be a 'delta' property that simply receives +- values for adjustments. Colorlight type : \"homie-capability-profile/v1/type=colorlight\" Example usages : Color control for a lightbulb or LED strip. Properties id type settable (default) retained unit format comment color color yes yes - rgb/hsv color-temperature integer yes yes Mired min:max fomat specifies min max values supported by the device","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#abstract","text":"This document aims to list a set of predefined device and capability profiles to be used in home automation scenarios.

The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material. Downstream recipients. A. Offer from the Licensor \u2013 Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 \u2013 License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You. b.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 \u2013 Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 \u2013 Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
